title: "Simple fabrication of a chitin wound healing membrane from Soft-Shell crab carapace"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-04-21-crab-carapace
excerpt: '
Minimal processing was required to fabricate a wound healing scaffold from soft-shell crab carapace, which has small prickles that improves cell adhesion and guide cell migration. Application of this wound-healing scaffold accelerated epidermis-dermis reattachment and improved wound topography.'
