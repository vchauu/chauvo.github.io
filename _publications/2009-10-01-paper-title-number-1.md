excerpt: 'Highlights:  
1. Minimal processing was required to fabricate a wound healing scaffold from soft-shell crab carapace.  
2. The carapace has small prickles that improves cell adhesion and guide cell migration.  
3. Epidermis-dermis reattachment was accelerated, and wound topography improved upon scaffold application.
